## 📂 Featured Projects  

### OR Scheduling System Redesign  
**Human-Centered Design | Healthcare Operations | Process Improvement**

This project focuses on redesigning an Operating Room scheduling process using a **human-centered design approach** to address inefficiencies, fairness concerns, and communication gaps commonly seen in hospital settings. Structured design methods such as **Frame Your Design Challenge, Brainstorming, and Theory of Change** were applied to develop solution concepts including a data-informed scheduling system, a streamlined shift-swapping mechanism, and a transparency-focused fairness dashboard. The project emphasizes user trust, clarity, and operational feasibility, while laying the foundation for future data-driven and automated scheduling solutions.


### Emergency Room Performance Monitor 
**Healthcare Analytics | Power BI | Operational Reporting**

This project presents a **Power BI dashboard** designed to summarize key Emergency Room performance metrics such as patient admissions, referrals, wait times, and demographics. The dashboard provides a consolidated, high-level view of ER operations to support performance monitoring and data-informed decision-making. While the current version focuses on static visual reporting, the project establishes a strong analytical base for future enhancements including interactivity, real-time monitoring, and predictive analytics.

- 🔹 **SM Paints – Process Improvement Simulation**  
  Built a discrete-event simulation model in Arena to analyze production bottlenecks and test process improvements. Recommended adding a dedicated quart filling line, which improved throughput and supported the company’s 98% on-time delivery goal.

- 🔹 **Raw Material Optimization**  
  Designed a linear programming model in Python to minimize raw material costs under supply, demand, and capacity constraints. Demonstrated how optimization can reduce procurement spend and improve sourcing efficiency.  

- 🔹 **Vendor Performance Analytics**  
  Built an analytics framework to evaluate supplier performance using delivery times, cost variability, and reliability metrics. Identified vendor concentration risks and highlighted diversification strategies for improved supply resilience.  

- 🔹 **Sales Dashboard (Power BI)**  
  Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales by region, product line, and time period. Delivered insights on revenue drivers, margin pressures, and target gaps, enabling faster decision-making.  

- 🔹 **Hospitalization Cost Prediction**  
  Applied regression and predictive modeling techniques to estimate hospitalization costs based on patient attributes (BMI, chronic conditions, etc.). Achieved strong accuracy and demonstrated applications in healthcare cost transparency and resource allocation.  

- 🔹 **CO₂ Emissions Reporting**  
  Created a Python-based pipeline for emissions data cleaning, reporting, and visualization. Highlighted patterns and anomalies in CO₂ emissions to support sustainability analysis and compliance reporting.
